# Variables are container for storing data values. Think of them as labeled boxes where information is stored for later use.

# Example 1: Creating name and assigning a value.
name = "Sajan"
age = 20
height = 5.7
is_student = True

print(name)
print(age)
print(height)
print(is_student)

# Example 2: Identifying data type for the variable. It can be done using type function.
print(type(name))
print(type(age))
print(type(height))
print(type(is_student))

# Example 3: Assigning values to multiple variables in a single line
a = b = c = 10
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

name, age, height, is_student = ("Sajina", 25, 5.5, False)
print(name)
print(age)
print(height)
print(is_student)

# Example 4: Swapping values of two variables
a, b = 5, 10
print(a)
print(b)

a, b = b, a
print(a)
print(b)

# Here we can see that the values of a and b have been interchanged. We did this without using any temporary variables. Python use unique feature called Tuple unpacking to do this.
